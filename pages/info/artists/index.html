                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p>I am a Chicago-based teacher and artist. I am drawn to patterns, structures and systems. I create art that makes my brain want to sing along. For me, mathematics and computation are tools for tinkering, experimentation and play. I
                        explore how techniques such as agent-based models, parametric design, dynamic geometry and recursive algorithms can be used to produce patterns and forms that balance opposing forces as they spread out across time and space. I
                        am inspired by natural structures and behaviors that have evolved over millions of years as well as the rich history of visual design across human cultures. I also enjoy yoga, guitar and piano, rock-climbing, taking photographs,
                        reading sci-fi, and I am equal parts fascinated by the natural world and robots.

                    <h3>Instrument:</h3>
                    <p>For my instrument, I chose to highlight the way that public sculptures and green spaces play a key role in making my local neighborhood an inviting and sustaining place to live. I live within walking distance of the North Pond in Lincoln
                        Park and have developed the habit of taking an almost daily stroll around the pond, with my camera in hand, to get some fresh air and enjoy the passage of time and the changing of seasons as it manifests in the natural word.</p>
                    <p>I also love the variety of public sculptures in and around Chicago. Whether biking the lakefront or walking through downtown, it is hard to travel far without encountering a public sculpture. The city itself becomes an art gallery
                        that you can move through and the diverse array of sculptures can serve as meeting points, landmarks, backdrops, objects to sketch and much more.</p>
                    <p>For my instrument, I selected one of my favorite sculptures that I encounter on my walks around the pond, located just outside the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. I used a field recorder and contact microphones to sample sounds from
                        different points on the sculpture as I struck it with a xylophone mallet. Due to the variability in the interior construction of the various limbs of the abstract tree form, I found three distinct sounds that I could use. As I
                        play, I take those sampled sounds and shift their pitch up or down as I lay out a sequence of sounds that I gradually mutate over time as I change a few notes at a time.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Instrument:</h3>
                    <p>I created a 3D pigeon collage that pays homage to one of the city’s most distinct street inhabitants. Over the pandemic, because I was spending so much time in my room, I noticed the pigeons that frequently visited my window ledge
                        and became increasingly fascinated by their mannerisms and sounds. Most people aren’t huge fans of pigeons, but I believe they deserve their own platform when mapping out the sounds and energy of NYC, which is why I chose to create
                        a pigeon-carried instrument.</p>
                    <p>The sounds are recordings of pigeon coos, movement, and other activity from both my phone and a pigeon-detector, set up using a raspberry pi. The images captured with the camera module are hung in the 3D space (built with Three JS)
                        and are attached to the recordings. The instrument builds on the manipulation of the images, making use of Three JS’s positional audio library. By altering the orientation and speed of each image, you can start to mimic the fluttering
                        of pigeon wings or the choral effect of a mass congregation of pigeons.</p>
                    <p>The instrument comes with a complete GUI user interface, allowing for users to change the x and y orientations of the images and the speed of the rotation (can be toggled on and off). Users can also drag the images in and out of the
                        scene or overlay them to create interesting mixes of sounds.</p>

                    <p>I am an artist interested in sound design and emerging technologies with a background in communication. I come from Ljubljana, Slovenia where I share a music production studio with like-minded artists. I like to create interactive
                        and collaborative sonified experiences, where my main goal is to question the relationship between visual and auditory systems. I believe that sound is a strong tool for elevating spirituality and consciousness and that music can
                        connect individuals from different cultures.

                    <h3>Instrument:</h3>
                    <p>In my home town of Ljubljana, firehouse communities are testing the alarm sirens every first Saturday of the month at 12 AM. It is a special experience because the firehouses are placed all around the town and the soundscape that emerges
                        is unique to every location. This event has been my starting point in developing my interest in speed and direction of a sound wave and how that relates to our interpretation of the soundscape. I wanted my instrument to abstractly
                        represent that idea, so I’ve decided to use an ultrasonic sensor which has a single oscillator to emit and receive ultrasonic waves. The time between the emitted and received frequency can be used to measure the distance between
                        a sensor and the object in front of it. Due to the historical event of the pandemic, where society has adapted to social distancing, I’ve designed an instrument that will measure the distance between me and other people. I plan
                        to use that instrument during live performances of IST in public spaces where the distance will be sonified and represented as a note of a siren sample that I recorded during one of the tests on the first saturday of the month
                        made by the local firemen.</p>

                    <p>I am an artist and creative technologist based in Mexico City, my interests in new media art are music technology, interfaces, interactive design and non linear narratives. For my work, sound is the most important thing for creating
                        engaging and immersive experiences, and one of the most powerful ways for communicating a message, music has always been very close to my artistic development.

                    <h3>Instrument:</h3>
                    <p>While doing the IMA Low Res masters program during COVID pandemics, I’ve spent most of my time in my studio taking classes or having meetings. During those times it was inevitable to hear street vendors on my street, selling traditional
                        street food from my country. I started paying attention to the different sounds those vendors used for announcing their products, and it also caused some curiosity to the people who were on the other side of the video calls. This
                        huge variety of sounds felt so unique to my city and in a way to my specific scenario, they became part of my identity inside an international cohort. I decided that those sounds would be my sonic material for creating my instrument
                        as a way for establishing an identity as mexican but with a localized approach instead of the most cliche ones, those were sounds I have grown listening to and noticed how that practice changed even in different neighborhoods.
                        The samples used on my instrument includes food as tamales or camotes, as well as other uses like the trash truck, local newspapers and junk buyers, each of the recordings are processed through Tone.js for allowing to happen on
                        a web environment, I use a synthesis technique called Granular, that chops the audio in micro cuts and then play them in a way they can create new timbres, my goal was to recreate those soundscapes on a deconstructed way for creating
                        rich textures and ethereal ambient sounds. For controlling it I am using a MIDI controller which sends messages over the web for triggering sounds and adjusting the effect chain as well as length of grains and overlap between them.

                <p>I am a theatre director, performer, and creative technologist from Austin, TX. I am fascinated by the connection between movement and digital outputs. I especially love when technology amplifies a visceral, physical performance while remaining
                    entertaining and magical. Growing up in Austin, I spent most of my time outdoors, running on Townlake trail, swimming at Deep Eddy, or taking my dogs to Redbud. I started theatre-making as a performer, mainly in musical theatre, until
                    I came to NYC and began studying at the Experimental Theatre Wing. There I was introduced to and began integrating technology into live performance. Since then, I have been a part of productions using VR, AR, projections, and IoT technology.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Instrument:</h3>
                <p>For my instrument, I chose to translate the sound of the highway close to my childhood home into music. For nearly a decade of my childhood, there was extensive construction on MoPac/Texas Loop 1. As the project progressed and neighbors
                    complained about the noise, the city erected huge barriers on the edges of the project to diffuse sound. I was always fascinated by these slabs of concrete and wondered about the engineering behind them.
                </p>
                <p>I moved back to Austin from NYC at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. I instantly noticed the lack of traffic noise that I had been accustomed to in the East Village, except for a low churning from MoPac just a couple of blocks away.
                    Over the course of my 16 months back in Austin, I noticed the sounds of this highway marking various events throughout the day: - The stillness of 6:00am when many are still waking up and the city is closest to silence. - The business
                    of midday as many rush around town and the wheels churn steadily across the pavement. - The heat, frustration, and horns of 5:00pm as thousands are stuck in traffic and wishing they were home.
                </p>
                <p>To capture these sounds, I strapped a raspberry pi with a vibration sensor to these walls and collected an hour of data at midday. These data are then used to trigger samples I have taken from the highway at the timestamps they occur.
                    For live performance, I control the dilation of time as well as the audio effects being applied to the samples.

                <p>Shanghai air is a manifestation of bringing invisible to a compression state of one voice. The idea of bringing invisible to visible and sound is a powerful transformational moment to me. This topic brings particular interest to me as
                    who suffers with sleep and respiratory problems during the time when air quality is not clearly identified in public space. With this action of bringing the air to a sound, it reminds me about the environmental issue around us and
                    it urgently needs to be recognized and addressed. In this instrument, it is carried with a special wearable design, this instrument can be carried around to the city. Walking is like playing an instrument…. THIS WILL BE UPDATED SOON.

                <p>Shanghai, to me, is a city full of billboards, beating with ever-changing colors, which brings me to the question, what would these billboards sound like if they were perceived not by the eye but by the ear? This question also has to do
                    with my curiosity about synesthetic experiences. Therefore, I also hope that performers can experience different sensory connections through simple interactions in work.
                </p>

                <p>I selected one of the pictures of Nanjing Road, a commercial street with the highest billboard density. Using a computer to analyze the color data and generate the corresponding tones, continuous music is generated as the mouse walks between
                    the different colors.
